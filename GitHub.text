Github works as a Git repository hosting service. It implies that github is an online database that permit us to 
keep track of and share our version of our git projects in our local computer or server. Github is explicitly 
could based. One of the exciting feature of Github is that we can share our codes with others through it. In 
addition, we can allow others to make revision or edits on my git branches. Through Github a team can 
coordinate with other team members on various projects in real time.
