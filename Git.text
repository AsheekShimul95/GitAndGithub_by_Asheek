Git is a fast way to handle projects online. It is an open source and free controlling system. Git was first 
developed in 2005. It is sometimes called as high quality version and control system. Git is installed and 
maintained in a local system and provides us self-contained record of our ongoing programming versions. One of the 
exciting feature of git is it's branching that enable us to create independent local branches in our codes. Git 
helps us to jump back to our earlier version of branches, delete, merge and recall branches very easily.
